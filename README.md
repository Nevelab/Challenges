Nevelab’s enterprise grade software is designed for teams to collaborate, experience social enterprises’ purposes and scale effective skills to perform more and be resilient in times of crisis.

Committing to a new operating model requires an <i>agile</i> methodology and prioritize innovative approaches, too often led from the top and most organizations cannot proceed with agile pilots forever. 
According to our research and experience many become resentful when agile teams make decisions and progress more swiftly as they deploy new concepts and receive resources that might otherwise be dedicated to more traditional business-as-usual initiatives.

Achieving these changes at scale requires alterations to the context in which people work and how traditional organizations evolve.

We've created a series of challenges by bringing together the best of many kinds of organizations, from both the public and private sectors, international organizations and academic institutions.

## Insights and reports
KPIs are imperative to your AI proof-of-concepts: we fully understand this. 
Here's how we will leverage the set up of the projects submitted:
- From team to code through a "lean startup" approach - taken in a broad sense - with a strong emphasis on design, user experience and continuous improvements of the product post launch.
- From code to the team with a "lean software factory" approach, which uses a "lean software development" to bring together agile practices, continuous integration (CI/CD) and finally a "product" approach.
- Help you deploy a perpetual loop and as an authentic organization in full synergy, around the products and services and the teams that build these products.
